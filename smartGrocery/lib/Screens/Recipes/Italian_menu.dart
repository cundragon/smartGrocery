        '2 cups almond meal or blanched ground almonds (Note 1)\n'
        '1/2 cup caster / superfine sugar (Note 2)\n'
        '2 tsp lemon zest (1 lemon)\n'
        '3 drops natural almond extract\n'
        '1/8 tsp salt\n'
        '1/2 cup dried cherries, chopped (Note 3)\n'
        '2 egg whites, at room temperature (from 2 large eggs, Note 4)\n'
        '2 tsp honey\n'
        'ALMOND COATING (OPTIONAL, NOTE 5):\n'
        '1 Extra egg white\n'
        '1 1/2 cups flaked almonds\n'
        '\nInstructions:\n'
        '1. Preheat oven to 190°C/375°F (170°C fan). Line 2 trays with baking/parchment paper.\n'
        '2. Combine Dry Ingredients: Place the almond meal, sugar, zest, almond extract, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together until zest and almond extract is evenly distributed. Add the cherries and set aside.\n'
        '3. Beat eggs whites: Using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the egg whites and honey to soft peaks (Note 5). About 2 minutes on Speed 8 of a handheld beater, or 1 1/2 minutes on Speed 6 of a stand mixer.\n'
        '4. Fold the beaten egg whites gently into the almond mixture. You will seemingly knock most of the air out of the meringue, that\'s ok! (You actually haven\'t 🙂 ).\n'
        'FORMING & COATING COOKIES:\n'
        '5. Place Extra egg white in a small bowl and whisk with a fork until foamy. Place flaked almonds in another bowl.\n'
        '6. Form 2.5cm/1" balls: Scoop up about 1 tablespoon of the mixture and shape into a rough ball (2.5cm/1" ball). I do this using 2 eating spoons – we don\'t need perfect balls here.\n'
        '7. Coat in egg whites: Drop the ball into foamy egg whites. Use 2 forks to turn to coat, then pick up and place in the flaked almonds.\n'
        '8. Almond coating: Coat cookies with the almonds, pressing them on to cover as completely as you can. Do not worry if you get some double layers or pieces sticking out – no need to be neat or thorough here!\n'
        '9. Bake 13 minutes: Place on the prepared tray 2.5cm / 1" apart. Bake for 13-15 minutes until golden brown. Start checking at 12 minutes to be sure the nuts aren’t burning.\n'
        '10. Cool: Transfer to rack to cool completely before serving.\n'
        '11. Store: Store in an airtight container. They last up to 10 days in a storage container or can be frozen.',
